-Moved media/favicon.ico to /favicon.ico

-Portfolio page!
-I have no idea why it broke, but when putting the footer into a js script, it no longer sticks to the bottom.
-Took all nav/menubar content out and made it a web component. Now this website is not js free, but I got it working. WOOOOOOOOOO!
note-What the ACTUAL fuck why does the css break if I take the parts only used in the navbar out and put them in a different stylesheet WHY
-Declared UTF-8 encoding. Even though I only use US-ASCII chars, no errors when looking at the console is incredibly satisfying.
-A whole 2 days later, I am putting the stylesheet as external, I am considering making a new page. The first will be pronouns.
